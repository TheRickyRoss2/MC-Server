# Welcome to configuring PrisonRankup, I will be here to guide you through this config setup
# First let me introduce myself, I am Mazen. I consider myself an expert in configuring Plugins and YAML configs and an advanced Java developer
# First thing I want you to do is to set the prefix (What comes before the message) for the plugin to use. Keep the speech marks please to avoid errors.
Prefix: '&a[&bPrison&6-&bRankup&a]'
#Do not touch this!
version: 3.0
# Next thing I want you to do is set the message you want it to be when somebody ranks up. Keep the speech marks here as well.
# The %player% will be replaced with the players name, and the %rank% will be replaced with the rank they ranked up to.
Rankup BC Message: '&3%player% &6has ranked up to &3%rank%'
# Now, the most important part of this plugin is the rankup ladder
groups:
#Heres an example of the format of how it should be:
# rank name:price
#DO NOT REMOVE THE # FROM THE ABOVE!
   - A:Free
   - B:1000
   - C:3000
   - D:5000
   - E:8000
   - F:10000
#Here, I will be asking you to put the first rank on the ladder in this example A
First Rank: 'A'
# As well as the last rank to assure that we can message the player that he is at the end of the ladder
Last Rank: 'C'
# This message is the message we will send to the player if he is the highest rank.
Highest Rank MSG: '&6 You are already the highest rank!'
# This next one is if you want to use a timed requirement for your rankup system, set it to true if yes. Default is false;
Timed Requirement: True
# Now we're if you set it to true you will have to set a certain time that you want to be done for the rank requirement
Time Interval: 5.2
# Here you will write what the time is based on, seconds, minutes or hours. Spelling does matter!
Time type: Seconds
# If you want, I added an option where you can choose if you want to make it so that the interval is added to every Rankup Sequence
Interval on all ranks: true
# Now you're almost there! Theres just one last part, If you're switching from Rankup and/or majority of Rankup plugins set this to true. If not, set it to false.
# What this does is check if the player has a rank that is listed in groups (Every minute) and if so, makes a profile with that rank.
Transfer ranks to profile: true
# Set the next item to false if you do not want to use the updater
update: true
# Set this to true if you wish to enable debug mode
debug: false
# This is the format of the ranks which will appear when a player does /ranks
#Variables are: %price%, %rank%
ranks-format: '&5[&3%rank%&5]&6: %price%'
# Here, is the message the player will recieve when he doesn't have enough money to rankup
#Varaibles are the same as the ones shown above
not-enough-money: '&6You need &2$%price% &6 to rankup to &2%rank%'
